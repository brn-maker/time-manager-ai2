# Cross-Day Activity Recording

## How to Record Cross-Day Activities

Your time manager app now supports recording activities that span across multiple days! Here's how to use it:

### Example: Recording Sleep (8pm Tuesday to 4am Wednesday)

1. **Open the app** and navigate to the date you want to start recording from (Tuesday)
2. **Add a new activity** by filling in the activity name (e.g., "Sleep")
3. **Toggle the "Use time range" switch** to enable cross-day recording
4. **Set the start date and time:**
   - Start Date: `2024-01-16` (Tuesday)
   - Start Time: `20:00` (8:00 PM)
5. **Set the end date and time:**
   - End Date: `2024-01-17` (Wednesday) 
   - End Time: `04:00` (4:00 AM)
6. **Click "Add Activity"**

### What Happens

- The app automatically calculates the duration (8 hours in this case)
- The activity will appear on **both** Tuesday and Wednesday
- On Tuesday, it shows as "Sleep: 8h" with "Cross-day activity" label
- On Wednesday, it shows the same activity
- The time range shows: "Jan 16 20:00 → Jan 17 04:00"

### Other Cross-Day Examples

- **Work shifts:** 11pm Monday to 7am Tuesday
- **Travel:** 10pm Friday to 6am Saturday  
- **Study sessions:** 9pm Sunday to 2am Monday
- **Any activity** that crosses midnight

### Backward Compatibility

- Old duration-based activities still work exactly as before
- You can mix both types of activities on the same day
- The toggle lets you choose between the two methods

### Benefits

✅ **Accurate time tracking** - No more guessing duration for cross-day activities  
✅ **Visual clarity** - See exactly when activities start and end  
✅ **Better analytics** - More precise data for your time management insights  
✅ **Flexible** - Works for any activity that spans multiple days
